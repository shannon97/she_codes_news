# Shannon Oliver - She Codes News Project

## About This Project
 Our class had to create a news website using Django with some starter code (https://github.com/SheCodesAus/plus-django-news-project-template) that allows users to read news stories, and authors to create them.

## How To Run This Code
   First clone the repo from to your local machine, then create and activate a virtualenvironment (venv) to be able to run your server through the manage.py file to see my website.
